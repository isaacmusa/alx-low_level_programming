Task 0. Multiple mains

Task 1. Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Task 2. ? That’s definitely not right.

Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

Task 3. This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
